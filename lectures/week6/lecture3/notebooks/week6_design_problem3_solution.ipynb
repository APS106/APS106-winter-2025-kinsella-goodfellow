Once all the words have been entered, the story will be output for everyone to read and enjoy.\n",

    "-\tStoring a long story in a form that can easily be modified\n",
    "-\tPrompting the user for words\n",
    "-\tReplacing the words in the story with the ones entered by the user\n",
    "-\tDisplaying the story\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious approach is to store the story as a string. However, how are we going to modify the story? (Strings are immutable!) How do we represent the words we want to replace with the user’s input?\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about the `replace` method this week. It allows you to find and replace sub-strings. So that seems promising. \n",
    "\n",
    "How are we going to represent missing words? One idea (which has some weaknesses) is to use unusual characters to represent the blanks. For example, we could store the blanks in the story between curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "`This is the {season} of our discount tent.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we want to replace all the words inside curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a Programming Plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\twrite a story and display a story. Notice we are doing the first and last thing in the algorithm but since they should be pretty easy it’s not a bad idea. This way we get a “working” program right away – but of course it only does part of what we want to do.\n",
    "2. change the story to write the word identifiers in curly braces\n",
    "3.\treplace one word: prompt user for one of the word identifiers and then replace it in the string\n",
    "4.\trepeat the code in step 3 for the other word identifiers. Since we’ve done it for one word identifier, it should be easy to do it for the rest (you don’t know about loops yet so just do the simplest thing you can think of)\n",
