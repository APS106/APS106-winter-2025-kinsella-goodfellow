    "\n",
    "You just finished your APS106 midterm and heading to dinner with a few friends. However, no one can decide what to eat. Recently, your friends have been watching the Big Bang Theory and are planning on using Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to truly make the game fun, you will be playing each other! The person with the best record in this round-robin tournament will decide what to eat. Thus, write a Python program using conditional statements and two user inputs to play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock against your friend.\n",

    "Keep in mind that you are hungry! Make sure your code is efficient, well-thought-out, and accounts for all possibilities.\n",
