    "Your good friend just introduced you to Wordle, the New York Times word-guessing game that went viral during the pandemic. As a problem-solver, this game has captivated your attention, but alas the NY Times only gives you one word a day, limiting how much you can be playing this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "You realize that with your recent knowledge of string manipulation you know enough to be dangerous and design your own (and maybe better!) Wordle game in Python. To design this game, you will be relying on your knowledge of strings and string methods, while and for loops, and escape characters for print formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your code is efficient, well-thought-out, and accounts for all possibilities so can start to Wordle as soon as possible.\n",

    "This is a word guessing game relying on string inputs, where we have to have an acceptable (real, 5-letter) word which is the solution, have acceptable user guesses, allow the user up to 6 guesses, and indicate to the user the correctness of their guess by color coding the letters, based on if they are correct and in correct position (green), the correct letter in wrong position (yellow) or not in the word (grey). The final program will obey the game's rules and account for all possible scenarios to be as comprehensive as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficult part of this programming exercise will be to define all the checks on the user input and indicating to the end user how close they are to the correct solution. Escape characters will be used to do the color coding part of the game, but you should still consider how to make your program respond once the user gets the correct guess (i.e. if you are using a loop to check the guess each time, how could you indicate when the game should stop?).\n",
