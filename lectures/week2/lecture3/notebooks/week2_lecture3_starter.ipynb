    "## I. An Engineering Design for Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of engineering is the design of objects, processes, and systems. From an engineering perspective, programming is the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of a piece of software that solves a particular problem. The software might be part of a larger system (e.g., the avionics software of an aircraft, the accounting or human resources software of a business), but it represents the solution to a design problem (or part of a design problem). We will therefore approach programing as an engineering design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **An Engineering Design Process (for programming):**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Define the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a clear and detailed problem statement. Be clear on what needs to be done. Sometimes the problem will be easy enough (especially as you are learning programming) that the initial problem statement given by the client/prof is sufficient. More often, the problem is complex enough that forming a complete, explicit definition is a challenge itself and sometimes (even, often) the client doesn‚Äôt really understand the problem him/herself. In such cases, research and iteration with the client is necessary.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/1define_problem.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Define Test Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Work out specific test cases for which you know the answer. This will help in the solidifying the problem definition and provide you with tests once you have working code. Try to cover a reasonable span of possible cases that may come up. Think about strange cases that might break the code. Think about reasonable measures of efficiency, speed, and memory size.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/2test_cases.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Generate Many Creative Solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about solutions and write them down. Try to be as creative as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ‚Äúsolution‚Äù at this stage is two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An Algorithm Plan**: a list of a few (from 4 or 5 to a dozen) steps that your algorithm will execute to solve the problem. These are high-level steps that can correspond to many lines of code. In real projects, these steps will themselves be subject to the design process (i.e. they will in turn be broken down into sub-steps perhaps may layers deep).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A Programming Plan**: a list of steps you will take in programming the algorithm. Sometimes this will be the form of programming, testing, and debugging each of the algorithm steps in order. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Especially for larger systems, the algorithm steps may be designed and implemented by different people in parallel or you may choose to program, test, and debug the hardest step first to make sure you understand the problem enough. Or you may decide to do the easiest steps first.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<big><b>The point is that you program not by trying to write all the code at once and then hoping it all works. Rather, you divide it up into a number of steps and make sure each step is implemented and works as you proceed.</b></big>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/3creative_solutions.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Select a Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the algorithm and programming plans you have generated. Does it appear that this solution will truly solve the problem? You may write some prototype code to understand if particular design ideas will work. Pick the best solution. If it is good enough, continue to Step 5, otherwise return to an earlier step (maybe even Step 1 as you have uncovered new parts of the problem definition).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/4select_solution.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Implement the Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow your chosen programming plan to implement the code. For each step in your programming plan, you should ensure that the code is working: it runs some ‚Äúsub-tests‚Äù correctly. Even though it doesn‚Äôt solve the whole problem, it should produce intermediate results that you can verify are correct. If it doesn‚Äôt, you should debug it before moving onto the next step. Implementation includes the documentation in the code: functions should have well-written docstrings and comments should be used ‚Äì it is better to over-comment than under-comment.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/5Implement.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Perform Final Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the solution against the test metrics, ensuring everything is in order. If the solution is not satisfactory, you need to either return to Step 5 to debug the code or return to Step 1 to develop a better understanding of the problem.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/6final_testing.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Remark: Design is Iterative**\n",
    "\n",
    "The above seems very proper and linear. Real programming isn't. Real programming is a but chaotic because you are creating something that doesn't yet exist and figuring out how to solve the problem as you go. Having some structure will help you not get lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most essential parts of all engineering design processes is iteration. Programming is no different. In fact, iteration may be even more important in programming because it is relatively inexpensive to write prototype code (compared to, say, building a prototype engine). This means that steps in the process are repeated over and over, in a loop. You might realize that you need to jump back to an earlier step because you missed a key requirement or because you mistakenly thought that you understood how to program a particular step. Each iteration brings with it an increased level of understanding of the problem that deepens your knowledge. Iteration may allow you to conceive solutions that were not initially apparent."
