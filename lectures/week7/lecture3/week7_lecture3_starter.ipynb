    "## Problem Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to use our programming skills and a tiny bit of linear algebra (we promise to keep it simple!) to create a program to perform least squares regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is least squares regression you ask? The least squares method is an approach used to approximate solutions to *overdetermined systems* (systems that have more equations than variables). Least squares has important applications in statistics, signal processing, machine learning, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. The figure below plots student quiz grades vs. the number of hours studied. \n",
    "\n",
    "![images/fig1.png](images/fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We would expect that students who studied longer achieve higher quiz grades, and the data suggest this is true. Now, let's say we want to define a function that, given the number of hours studied by a student, provided the expected quiz grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$expected\\_grade = f(study\\_hours)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have 25 data points, we could fit a degree 24 polynomial to fit the data perfectly, but looking at the plot, it doesn't seem that this function represents reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/fig2.png](images/fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "More likely, it looks like there is a linear relationship between the study hours and quiz grade. So we'll assume the function is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$expected\\_grade = f(study\\_hours) = \\beta_1study\\_hours + \\beta_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So to finish defining our function, we need to determine the values of $\\beta_1$ (the slope) and $\\beta_0$ (the intercept).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having taken MAT188 you might be tempted to set this up as a linear system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "45\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "30 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But now you realize that this system cannot be solved because there is no values of $\\beta_{1/0}$ that satisfy all the equations! This is where the least squares approach comes in. The least squares method will give us values of $\\beta$ that minimize the squared error between the function output and the real data. \n",
    "\n",
    "![images/fig3.png](images/fig3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're not in math class, we'll skip over the derivation of the method, and say that the solution to the least squares problem is to adjust the system of equations slightly to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X^T X\\begin{bmatrix} \n",

    "\\beta_0 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "=\n",
    "X^{T}y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is our data matrix with the number of hours studied and $y$ is the vector of quiz grades. Now $X^TX$ is a $2x2$ matrix and $X^Ty$ is a $2x1$ vector and we have a system that can be solved. \n",
