    "# APS106 Design Problem - Connect 4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem background\n",
    "You're studying for your next APS106 midterm and starting to feel nostalgic for the board games you used to play as a kid. Instead of going down a YouTube video rabbit hole, you decide to turn your nostalgia into study motivation and write a program to play your favourite childhood game: Connect 4!\n",

    "### Review of Connect 4 Game rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connect 4** is a classic two-player strategy game that is played on a vertical grid consisting of 6 rows and 7 columns. The objective of the game is for one player to get **four of their tokens in a row**, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing the other player from doing the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Setup\n",
    "- The game board is a grid of **6 rows** and **7 columns**.\n",
    "- Each player has their own tokens:\n",
    "  - Player 1: **'X'** (Red)\n",
    "  - Player 2: **'O'** (Yellow)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Rules\n",
    "1. **Taking Turns**:\n",
    "   - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.\n",
    "   - On a turn, a player chooses a column and drops their token into that column. \n",
    "   - The token will occupy the **lowest available position** in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Winning the Game**:\n",
    "   - A player wins by forming a line of **four consecutive tokens** in one of the following directions:\n",
    "     - **Horizontal**: Four tokens in a row across the same row.\n",
    "     - **Vertical**: Four tokens in a column.\n",
    "     - **Diagonal**: Four tokens connected diagonally, either from top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Draw**:\n",
    "   - If all columns are filled and neither player has four in a row, the game ends in a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Invalid Moves**:\n",
    "   - A player cannot drop a token into a column that is already full. If this happens, the player must choose a different column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Gameplay\n",
    "Below is an example of a game board after a few turns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  \n",
    "1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  \n",
    "2 |   |   |   | X |   |   |   |  \n",
    "3 |   |   | O | O |   |   |   |  \n",
    "4 |   | X | X | X | O |   |   |  \n",
    "5 | X | O | O | X | O |   |   |  \n",
    "    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Player 1 is using **'X'** and Player 2 is using **'O'**.\n",
    "- Player 1 is one token away from winning with a horizontal line in row 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Programming Challenge\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement **Connect 4** in Python. The game will:\n",
    "1. Allow two players to take turns entering their moves.\n",
    "2. Check for valid moves.\n",
    "3. Determine if there is a winner after each move.\n",
    "4. Display the game board after every turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will help you practice working with:\n",
    "- **Nested lists** to represent the game board.\n",
    "- **Loops** and **conditionals** to manage gameplay.\n",
    "- **Functions** to structure and modularize your code.\n",
    "- **User input validation** to ensure proper gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will have built a fully functional Connect 4 game in Python! As usual, we'll break the game into smaller pieces to make it more manageable."

    "## Part 0 - Creating and printing a board\n",
    "We'll start with defining a couple of helper functions:\n",
    "1. `create_empty_board`\n",
    "2. `print_board`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_empty_board` function creates a 2-dimensional nested list that we will use to represent the game board.\n",
    "In our Connect 4 game, the **board** is represented using a **nested list**. Here's an explanation of the structure and its design:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Nested List\n",
    "The board is implemented as a **list of lists**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Each inner list** represents a **row** of the game board.\n",
    "- **Each element** within an inner list represents a **cell or space** in the board.\n",
    "- The dimensions of the board are **6 rows x 7 columns**, following the standard Connect 4 rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of an Empty Board\n",
    "When the game starts, the nested list is initialized to represent an empty board, where each cell is set to a string containing a single space character (`\" \"`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "board = [\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 1 (Top)\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 2\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 3\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 4\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 5\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"]   # Row 6 (Bottom)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing the board as tokens are added\n",
    "As players take turns and add their tokens to the board, the elements of the nested list will be changed from spaces (`\" \"`) to strings containing the token of the player (`\"X\"` or `\"O\"`). For example, after a few turns, the board could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "board = [\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 1 (Top)\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 2\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 3\n",
    "    [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 4\n",
    "    [\"O\", \" \", \" \", \"X\", \" \", \" \", \" \"],  # Row 5\n",
    "    [\"X\", \" \", \"X\", \"O\", \"O\", \" \", \" \"]   # Row 6 (Bottom)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print_board` function can be used to display the placement of all tokens and empty spaces within the board."

    "### Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `drop_token(board, column, token)`\n",
    "This function simulates dropping a token into a specified column of the Connect 4 board. When a player selects a column, the token should \"fall\" to the lowest available row in that column. If the column is already full, the function should indicate that the move is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Parameters:**\n",
    "    - `board`: A nested list representing the game board (6 rows x 7 columns).\n",
    "    - `column`: An integer representing the column number (1-indexed) where the player wants to drop their token.\n",
    "    - `token`: A string (`\"X\"` or `\"O\"`) representing the player's token.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavior:**\n",
    "    - **Valid Move:** The token is placed in the lowest available row of the specified column.\n",
    "    - **Invalid Move:** If the column is already full or if the column number is invalid, the function should return an error message indicating the move cannot be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Value:**\n",
    "    - Return `True` if the token was successfully placed.\n",
    "    - Return `False` if the move is invalid (e.g., the column is full or the column number is out of range).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the column is invalid, your function should print one of the following error messages:\n",
    "* `\"Column is full!\"` if the selected column is already full of tokens\n",
    "* `\"Invalid column number!\"` if the column number is below 0 or greater than 6.\n",

    "## Test cases\n",
    "Some test scenarios we will want to test are:\n",
    "1. An invalid column number.\n",
    "2. Adding a token to an empty column.\n",
    "3. Adding a token to a non-empty and non-full column.\n",
