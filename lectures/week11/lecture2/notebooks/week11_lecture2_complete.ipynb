    "### How to Create Your Own Module in Python\n",
    "Creating your own module is useful when the variables, functions, or classes you're creating in a `.py` file or `.ipynb` file are generic and likely to be used across many notebooks, projects, assignments, etc. For example, it would be silly to continually create `sine` functions in everythin notebook. This is why someone created the `math` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module in Python is simply a file with a `.py` extension that contains Python code. To create a module, you just need to write your code in a `.py` file and save it with an appropriate name. When you import a module in Python, the interpreter searches for the module in the following locations:\n",
